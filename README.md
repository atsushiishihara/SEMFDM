# SEMFDM

This code calculates thermal diffusion in temperature fields for point heat sources, such as SEM microprobes, using the finite difference method. 2 types are available: fixed point heat source mode and raster scan mode.
This code has been verified to run with CUDA Toolkit 12.8 and conda 24.11.3 (Python 3.12.3).
Set the various parameters appropriately for each material, and configure a directory to store the files output to the Output_Directory.
